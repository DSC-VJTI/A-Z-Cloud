<p>An introduction to the A-Z of Cloud</p>

</div>

<p>An initiative by the Cloud Computing Core Team at Google Developer Student Clubs, Veermata Jijabai Technological Insitute, <strong>A-Z Cloud</strong> exposes you to 26 concepts and related cloud technologies from A-Z.</p>
<p>Concepts like <strong>A</strong>utomation, <strong>B</strong>ig Data and more are covered with related cloud tech that begin with the same letter.</p>
<p>Many services of Google Cloud Platform are mentioned with each concept. To get hands-on practice, the revelant codelaba on <a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/">Google Cloud Skills Boost</a> are provided with each article.</p>

	<blockquote>
<p>The rule of the cloud is to ruthlessly automate everything</p>
<p>- Patrick Gelsinger, CEO Intel, ex-CEO VMWare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from taking advantage of compute resources, such as a remote server or a database, cloud computing in its essence deals with automation of the software delivery process. The following are the 3 steps that are automated in this delivery process:</p>
<h3 id="application-development">Application Development</h3>
<p>There are several tasks that a developer would like to include in their development workflow such as running unit tests, deploying the application on each new change, let&rsquo;s say this change is making a new commit to a GitHub repository. Such repetitive tasks can be automated on GitHub with the help of <strong>A</strong>ctions.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-configuration">Deployment Configuration</h3>
<p>Say you are building a Python or a Node.js web application. What software does your local machine need to run this project? Let&rsquo;s start from the basics, an operating system. Node.js or the Python interpreter to run the scripts that you&rsquo;ll write, <code>npm</code> or <code>pip</code> to install and manage the required dependencies and so on. Now what if you have to deploy this application, say on Heroku or Google <strong>A</strong>pp Engine. You only provide the source code and the list of dependencies to it. However, behind the scenes, there are a lot more configurations that are done for you. Such as the choice of the machine/server on which your code will run, the operating system it will run on, etc. All of this is part of deployment configuration which is automated for you. As a developer, you only provide the code and the platform does the configurations for you.</p>
<p>This concept can also be extended to Infrastructure-as-Code. What if you want to specify the kind of machine your code should run on, the operating system that your code runs on, the version of Python or Node.js runtime that you need? With this, you have a lot more configurations to be done on your own. For big companies, with many such applications deployed, imagine how many such configurations they have to specify for each deployment? In order to automate configurations for Infrastructure-as-Code, many cloud technologies are available today, namely <strong>A</strong>nsible, Puppet, Chef.</p>
<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>
<p>Imagine you have built a web application deployed using some cloud service and is accessed by hundreds of users every week. Let&rsquo;s say it is your personal blog. One of your stories becomes a major hit and now you get thousands of users visitng your website, interacting with it. We can say that now there is an increased <em>load</em> on your website. How will you deal with this? This additional load can be carried out by autoscaling which is provided out of the box by most cloud platforms providing compute resources. By autoscaling, the number of servers or virtual machines running on a single server can be <em>scaled</em> as per the load without requiring any manual intervention.</p>

    <div class="lead">Automate your development process with GitHub Actions</div>
	<p>To quickly see GitHub Actions in <em>action</em>, check out the <code>.github</code> directory in the source code of this website <a href="https://github.com/DSC-VJTI/a-z-cloud/tree/main/.github">here</a>. You can see the following directory structure:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.github
├── dependabot.yml
└── workflows
    └── gh-pages.yaml
</code></pre><p>There is a <code>.yaml</code> or YAML (which stands for YAML Ain&rsquo;t Markup Language) file that defines some workflow or a set of tasks that will be run on each <em>event</em> on the GitHub repository.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-_event_">What is an <em>event</em>?</h3>
<p>An event is a specific change made to your GitHub repository that should trigger your desired workflow. This event can be a new push, a new issue or a pull request made to the repository.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-_workflow_">What is a <em>workflow</em>?</h3>
<p>A set of automated tasks that are to be run of a specific event. A workflow is composed of several <em>jobs</em> and is defined in a YAML file such as specified above with <code>gh-pages.yaml</code>. This is how this file looks:</p>

<p>Big data is a term that describes large, hard-to-manage volumes of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundate businesses on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Following are a few examples of big data databases, just to give y&rsquo;all an idea of how big this could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>New York Stock Exchange</em> is an example of Big Data that generates about <strong>one terabyte ( 10^12 bytes ◉‿◉)</strong> of new trade data per day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single Jet engine can generate <strong>10+ terabytes</strong> of data in 30 minutes of flight time. With many thousand flights per day, generation of data reaches up to many Petabytes.</p>

    <div class="lead">Store your Big Data in fast and highly scalable BigTable storage services.</div>
	<p>Cloud Bigtable is a sparsely populated table that can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns, enabling you to store terabytes or even petabytes of data. A single value in each row is indexed; this value is known as the row key. Bigtable is ideal for storing very large amounts of single-keyed data with very low latency. It supports high read and write throughput at low latency, and it is an ideal data source for MapReduce operations.</p>
<p>Bigtable is exposed to applications through multiple client libraries, including a supported extension to the Apache HBase library for Java. As a result, it integrates with the existing Apache ecosystem of open-source Big Data software.</p>
<p>Bigtable&rsquo;s powerful back-end servers offer several key advantages over a self-managed HBase installation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incredible scalability</strong> Bigtable scales in direct proportion to the number of machines in your cluster. A self-managed HBase installation has a design bottleneck that limits the performance after a certain threshold is reached. Bigtable does not have this bottleneck, so you can scale your cluster up to handle more reads and writes.</li>
<li><strong>Simple administration</strong> Bigtable handles upgrades and restarts transparently, and it automatically maintains high data durability. To replicate your data, simply add a second cluster to your instance, and replication starts automatically. No more managing replicas or regions; just design your table schemas, and Bigtable will handle the rest for you.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster resizing without downtime</strong> You can increase the size of a Bigtable cluster for a few hours to handle a large load, then reduce the cluster&rsquo;s size again—all without any downtime. After you change a cluster&rsquo;s size, it typically takes just a few minutes under load for Bigtable to balance performance across all of the nodes in your cluster.</li>

<p>As cloud native approaches gather steam, CI/CD practices have to evolve to maintain stability as you increase speed. Because without the right guard rails, it’s like attaching a rocket ship to a go kart. It’s not a very fun ride.</p>
<p>- Ravi Tharisayi, ex-Team Lead and Principal Advisor at IBM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) embody a culture, set of operating principles, and collection of practices that enable application development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. The implementation is also known as the CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p>CI/CD tools help store the environment-specific parameters that must be packaged with each delivery. CI/CD automation then performs any necessary service calls to web servers, databases, and other services that may need to be restarted or follow other procedures when applications are deployed.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>It is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes and check in code to version control repositories frequently. Because most modern applications require developing code in different platforms and tools, the team needs a mechanism to integrate and validate its changes.</p>
<p>The technical goal of CI is to establish a consistent and automated way to build, package, and test applications. With consistency in the integration process in place, teams are more likely to commit code changes more frequently, which leads to better collaboration and software quality.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery </h3>
<p>CD picks up where continuous integration ends. CD automates the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments. Most teams work with multiple environments other than the production, such as development and testing environments, and CD ensures there is an automated way to push code changes to them.</p>
<p>A typical CD pipeline has build, test, and deploy stages. More sophisticated pipelines include many of these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulling code from version control and executing a build.</li>
<li>Executing any required infrastructure steps that are automated as code to stand up or tear down cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li>Moving code to the target computing environment.</li>
<li>Managing the environment variables and configuring them for the target environment.</li>
<li>Pushing application components to their appropriate services, such as web servers, API services, and database services.</li>
<li>Executing any steps required to restarts services or call service endpoints that are needed for new code pushes.</li>
<li>Executing continuous tests and rollback environments if tests fail.</li>
<li>Providing log data and alerts on the state of the delivery</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-cicd-pipelines-with-kubernetes-and-serverless-architectures">Implementing CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes and serverless architectures </h3>
<p>Many teams operating CI/CD pipelines in cloud environments also use <strong>c</strong>ontainers such as <strong>Docker</strong> and orchestration systems such as <strong>Kubernetes</strong>. Containers allow for packaging and shipping applications in standard, portable ways. Containers make it easy to scale up or tear down environments that have variable workloads.</p>
<p>There are many approaches to using containers, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD pipelines together. You can explore options such as Kubernetes with Jenkins or Kubernetes with Azure DevOps.</p>
<p>Serverless computing architectures present another avenue for deploying and scaling applications. In a serverless environment, the infrastructure is fully managed by the cloud service provider and the application consumes resources as needed based on its configuration.</p>

	<blockquote>
<p>Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-are-containers">What are containers?</h3>
<p>Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop. From Gmail to YouTube to Search, everything at Google runs in containers. Containerization allows our development teams to move fast, deploy software efficiently, and operate at an unprecedented scale.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-containers-used-for">What are containers used for?</h3>
<p>Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developer’s personal laptop.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="microservices">Microservices:</h4>
<p>Containers are small and lightweight, which makes them a good match for microservice architectures where applications are constructed of many, loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 id="devops">DevOps:</h4>
<p>The combination of microservices as an architecture and containers as a platform is a common foundation for many teams that embrace DevOps as the way they build, ship and run software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 id="hybrid-multi-cloud">Hybrid, multi-cloud:</h4>
<p>Because containers can run consistently anywhere, across laptop, on-premises and cloud environments, they are an ideal underlying architecture for hybrid cloud and multicloud scenarios where organizations find themselves operating across a mix of multiple public clouds in combination with their own data center.</p>

<p>DevOps is not a goal, but a never-ending process of continual improvement</p>
<p>- Jez Humble, Site Reliability Engineering at Google Cloud, co-author of The DevOps Handbook</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before attempting to define DevOps, let&rsquo;s first make it clear - Dev means software development and Ops means operations required to ship and maintain this software.</p>
<p>DevOps is an approach to bring both, the development and the operations cycles together. As student developers, we are usually on the developer cycle - plan a new feature, build it, push it - deployment and similar operations usually come last. However, DevOps advocates for practices wherein each new development in the software is followed by a series of steps such as configuration, deployment, monitoring, quality assurance, and a lot more.</p>
<p><img src="devops.png" alt="The DevOps cycle"></p>
<p>But why do such operations need to be coupled with the development cycle? To increase velocity of delivering new features of a project with CI/CD and automation. Companies like Google and Meta make more than 10000 production pushes in a day across services; this is made possible by adopting DevOps practices, for e.g. according to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzLa0YEbGIY">talk</a> in 2018, Amazon makes a production push every 11.6 seconds! It also helps to create reliable applications, for example, if you detect an issue or bug in production, a minimal change can be quickly reflected if you have a CI/CD pipeline in place.</p>
<p>How do we implement the DevOps cycle? For the operations cycle to be integrated with software development, there need to be technologies that allow us to package, configure and easily deploy our code. Containerization is an approach that is widely adopted for the same. And what technology pioneered the use of containers? - <strong>D</strong>ocker!</p>

    <div class="lead">The pioneer in containerization</div>
	<p>Docker provides various services such as the Docker daemon (<code>dockerd</code>), Docker CLI, and Docker Hub Registry that help package applications in containers and host them. As we learned in <a href="/a-z-cloud/docs/c/containers/" title="Containers">containers</a>, the several problems of software not being able to run on some machine and portability of software are solved by containers and Docker provides salient tools to make it possible.</p>

<h2 id="docker-architecture">Docker architecture</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss the architecture of Docker Engine which comprises of Docker client (CLI), Docker Host that contains the Docker daemon which manages the different containers, and the software that needs to be packaged to a container i.e., an image made available on a registry.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yahya-Al-Dhuraibi/publication/308050257/figure/fig1/AS:433709594746881@1480415833510/High-level-overview-of-Docker-architecture.png" alt="Docker architecture"></p>
<h3 id="docker-hub">Docker Hub</h3>
<p>This is the default registry that Docker uses to fetch <em>images</em> to be run inside containers. But what is an image? A Docker image is a template file that contains the instructions to create a container. Each image has a base image typically a minimal Linux-based operating system such as Alpine and on top of this image, we can add layers of our own images. This can be done using a <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p>

</div>
	<blockquote>
<p>Microservices — is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.</p>
<p>- Chris Richardson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before understanding Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), let&rsquo;s first understand what an event is,</p>
<p>An <strong>event</strong> is a state change or an update within the system that triggers the action of other systems. It can be anything from a transaction and sensor input to a mouse click and a photo upload, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>With that said,</p>
<p><strong>Event-driven architecture</strong> is a design model that connects distributed software systems and allows for efficient communication. EDA makes it possible to exchange information in real time or near real time. It is common in designing apps that rely on microservices (you&rsquo;ll get to know what this mean real soon but for now consider that <em>when each service runs its own process and communicates through APIs with other services, then these services are considered as microservices</em>.)</p>
<p>The concept of event-driven architecture is mainly realized through the publish/subscribe communication model (We covered this during GCP'21, hope y&rsquo;all remember!).</p>
<br>
<p>Just to brief,</p>
<p>Publish/subscribe is a flexible messaging pattern that allows disparate system components to interact with one another asynchronously.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-event-driven-architecture-work">How does event-driven architecture work?</h3>
<p>Event-driven architecture is made up of event producers and event consumers. An event producer detects or senses an event and represents the event as a message. It does not know the consumer of the event, or the outcome of an event.</p>
<p>After an event has been detected, it is transmitted from the event producer to the event consumers through event channels, where an event processing platform processes the event asynchronously. Event consumers need to be informed when an event has occurred. They might process the event or may only be impacted by it.</p>
<p>The event processing platform will execute the correct response to an event and send the activity downstream to the right consumers. This downstream activity is where the outcome of an event is seen.</p>
<p><img src="EDA.svg" alt="EDA"></p>
<h3 id="where-can-this-approach-be-used-in-your-next-project">Where can this approach be used in your next project?</h3>
<p><strong>To monitor and receive alerts</strong> for any anomalies or changes to storage buckets, database tables, virtual machines, or other resources.</p>
<p><strong>To fan out a single event to multiple consumers.</strong> The event router will push the event to all the appropriate consumers, without you having to write customized code. Each service can then process the event in parallel, yet differently.</p>
<p><strong>To provide interoperability between different technology stacks</strong> while maintaining the independence of each stack.</p>

    <div class="lead">A unified eventing experience in Google Cloud.</div>
	<p>Eventarc allows you to build event-driven architectures without having to implement, customize, or maintain the underlying infrastructure. Eventarc offers a standardized solution to manage the flow of state changes, called events, between decoupled microservices. When triggered, Eventarc routes these events through Pub/Sub subscriptions to various destinations while managing delivery, security, authorization, observability, and error-handling for you.</p>
<p>You can manage Eventarc from the Google Cloud Console, from the command line using the gcloud CLI, or by using the Eventarc API.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-eventarc">Benefits Of Eventarc</h3>
<p>Eventarc provides an easier path to receive events not only from Pub/Sub topics but from a number of Google Cloud sources with its Audit Log and Pub/Sub integration. Any service with Audit Log integration or any application that can send a message to a Pub/Sub topic can be event sources for Eventarc. You don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure with Eventarc. It is a managed service with no clusters to set up or maintain.</p>
<p>It also has some concrete benefits beyond the easy integration. It provides consistency and structure to how events are generated, routed, and consumed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the serverless world, Function-as-a-Service allows to write small pieces of code that do something Just like any other function, but serverless. That means: The function is sleeping in a fluffy cloudy container and only when it is needed, it wakes up and does something, and the good news: A sleeping function doesn’t cause cost.</p>
<p>- Carlos Roggan</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-is-function-as-a-service">What is Function-as-a-Service?</h3>
<p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a serverless way to execute modular pieces of code on the edge. FaaS lets developers write and update a piece of code on the fly, which can then be executed in response to an event, such as a user clicking on an element in a web application. This makes it easy to scale code and is a cost-efficient way to implement microservices.</p>
<p>Hosting a software application on the internet typically requires provisioning and managing a virtual or physical server and managing an operating system and web server hosting processes. With FaaS, the physical hardware, virtual machine operating system, and web server software management are all handled automatically by your cloud service provider. This allows you to focus solely on individual functions in your application code.</p>
<h3 id="how-faas-works">How FaaS works?</h3>
<p>FaaS gives developers an abstraction for running web applications in response to events, without managing servers. For example, uploading a file could trigger custom code that transcodes the file into a variety of formats.
FaaS infrastructure is usually metered on-demand by the service provider, primarily through an event-driven execution model, so it’s there when you need it but it doesn’t require any server processes to be running constantly in the background, like platform-as-a-service (PaaS) would. </p>
<p>Functions can be accessed through one of several triggers that you define when you create the function. For use in an app, functions can occur on events that happen in the database. For example, a function can be triggered when a new item is written to a database, changed, or deleted from the database.</p>
<p>An “on-event” function might send an email to a user when their account is created. A function could also be written to send a notification to a user, or set of users, in a chatroom when a new message has been written to the room (equivalent to a new write on the database).</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-using-faas">What are the advantages of using FaaS?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved developer velocity</strong>
With FaaS, developers can spend more time writing application logic and less time worrying about servers and deploys. This typically means a much faster development turnaround.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in scalability</strong>     <br>
Since FaaS code is inherently scalable, developers don’t have to worry about creating contingencies for high traffic or heavy use. The serverless provider will handle all of the scaling concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Cost efficiency</strong>      <br>
Unlike traditional cloud providers, serverless FaaS providers do not charge their clients for idle computation time. Because of this, clients only pay for as much computation time as they use, and do not need to waste money
over-provisioning cloud resources.</li>
<li>Functions can be written in almost any programming language</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-drawbacks-of-faas">What are the drawbacks of FaaS?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less system control</strong>      <br>
Having a third party manage part of the infrastructure makes it tough to understand the whole system
and adds debugging challenges.</li>
<li><strong>More complexity required for testing</strong>     <br>
It can be very difficult to incorporate FaaS code into a local testing environment, making thorough testing 	of an application a more intensive task.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<p>Because it enables transactions to be isolated and scaled easily, FaaS is good for high-volume and embarrassingly parallel workloads. It can also be used to create backend systems or for activities such as data processing, format conversion, encoding, or data aggregation.
FaaS is also a good tool for Web apps, backends, data/stream processing, or to create online chatbots or back ends for IoT devices.</p>
<p>FaaS can help you manage and use third-party services. If you’re considering Android app development, for example, you can adopt a FaaS approach to keep your costs in check. Because you’re only charged when your app connects to the cloud for a specific function like batch processing, costs can be considerably lower than they would using a traditional approach.</p>
<h3 id="faas-vs-serverless">FaaS vs Serverless</h3>
<p>Serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) are often conflated with one another but the truth is that FaaS is actually a subset of serverless. Serverless is focused on any service category, be it compute, storage, database, messaging, api gateways, etc. where configuration, management, and billing of servers are invisible to the end user. FaaS, on the other hand, while perhaps the most central technology in serverless architectures, is focused on the event-driven computing paradigm wherein application code, or containers, only run in response to events or requests.
The combination of FaaS and common back-end services (such as databases, messaging, and authentication) connected primarily through an event-driven architecture is what provides the best benefits for serverless developers.</p>

    <div class="lead">Create functions that respond to events generated by Firebase and Google Cloud features.</div>
	<blockquote>
<p>Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your JavaScript or TypeScript code is stored in Google&rsquo;s cloud and runs in a managed environment. There&rsquo;s no need to manage and scale your own servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-is-firebase-cloud-functions">What is Firebase Cloud Functions?</h3>
<p>Firebase Cloud Functions in particular are like Lego blocks that you can connect to any Firebase service. For example, a function can be triggered when an image is uploaded to Firebase Storage to create a thumbnail, or maybe clean some user data when a node is deleted in the Realtime Database. Pretty much anything of interest that happens in Firebase can trigger a function.
If that isn’t enough, you can also use HTTP to trigger functions with GET, POST, etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>Cloud Functions for Firebase lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your code is stored in Google’s cloud and runs in a managed environment. There’s no need to manage and scale your own servers, for example, if we have a chatting mobile app that uses firebase to store the messages and we want to filter the messages before they are written to the database so as to make sure there are no bad words included in any message, before the cloud functions were made that was really hard to achieve and most probably we would need someone to write a backend code to do this check, but today, all we need to do is just write a simple cloud function that triggers whenever any message is added to our database and filter it out.</p>
<p>It is very powerful especially for mobile developers that have no knowledge on how to write web apps or backend, you can also integrate with third-party APIs like Slack and Github.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<p>Cloud Functions allows developers access to Google Cloud events and Firebase, along with scalable computing power for running the code in response to those events. It is expected that Firebase applications will use Cloud Functions in unique ways to meet their unique and specific needs, use cases may fall into the following areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notifying users when something interesting happens.</li>
<li>Performing Realtime Database maintenance and sanitization.</li>
<li>Executing intensive tasks in the cloud rather than executing in our application.</li>
<li>Integrate with APIs and third-party services.</li>

    <div class="lead"><h2 id="geographic-information-system">Geographic Information System</h2>
</div>
	<p>A geographic information system (GIS) is a system that creates and manages geographic data (data for which location is relevant), analyzes this geographic data, and maps it. Hence the four main ideas of such as system are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create geographic data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage it in a database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze and find patterns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visualize it on a map</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the use of GIS in a food delivery tracker in a mobile app where the location of your meal is continually fethced from an API providing geographic data. This data is then analyzed to give you an estimated time of delivery and all of this is being mapped and visualized in the mobile app in real-time.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-cloud-computing-come-into-the-picture">How does cloud computing come into the picture?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Geographic data such as location or coordinates along with spatial data such as the shapes that make up a geography such as a point, line, polygon, etc. These data together form geospatial data which is complex in nature and takes up a lot more space than the traditional relational data. Hence cloud is leveraged to store copious amounts of such data and analysis is carried out using Big Data services such as BigQuery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, it became essential to create visualizations of real-time changes in COVID cases. To manage such real-time changes, data from several APIs needs to be consumed to produce a new change and hence, services such as Cloud Pub/Sub can be seen here.</p>

<p>What does buying a car and managing a cloud environment have in common? If you don&rsquo;t pay attention they both can end up costing you much more than expected. That’s why keeping a close eye on your cloud environment is very important, <strong>and this is what health checks do</strong>.</p>
<p>Health Checks check the working status of your servers by sending them periodic messages, the servers in turn reply to these messages. If the server fails to respond to these messages, it would be considered that the server isn&rsquo;t functioning properly and appropriate actions would be taken.</p>
<p>The actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending Emails to the administrator</li>
<li>Sending SMS to the administrator</li>
<li>Running some scripts</li>
<li>And many others.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Improved cloud governance</p>
<p>Your cloud environment is only as good as the hygiene that you establish for it— and your organization’s diligence to keep those practices in place long term. Especially if you are just starting in your cloud environment, you might not be aware of common pitfalls. For example, assets that are unallocated or untagged, such as untagged instances, are very common. If not addressed quickly, they can lead to a lot of cloud resource waste. The Health Check gives you a quick snapshot to help identify these assets and allow you to build and customize reports to focus on a particular business unit, owner, environment or function.</p>

<li>
<p>De-risk your cloud with confidence</p>
<p>Security is a critical component for any cloud environment. In this day and age, keeping data safe and secure is equally, if not more important, than reducing cost increasing agility. Health Checks highlights any potential security vulnerabilities. This alerts your team to take any necessary actions needed before something can potentially go wrong.

<div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
<p>IaaS</p>

</div>
 -->
<h3 id="what-is-infrastructure-as-a-service">What is Infrastructure-as-a-Service?</h3>
<p>Infrastructure as a Service is a type of cloud computing service providing computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing services. The other two are Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) means that the infrastructure is hosted on the public and/or private cloud, instead of on an on-premises server. It’s delivered to customers on-demand and is fully managed by the IaaS provider. This includes all the infrastructure components an on-premises data center would traditionally entail, such as servers, networking hardware, and storage.</p>
<p>Often, the IaaS provider also offers a range of services to complement those components, such as detailed billing, security, monitoring, and clustering. Storage resiliency, like backup and recovery processes, is also included. IaaS allows users to develop, grow, and scale without buying and maintaining physical hardware.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-infrastructure-as-a-service">Benefits of Infrastructure-as-a-Service</h3>
<p>You can think of infrastructure as a service a little bit like taxis or hotels. It would be extremely inefficient for people to try to own transportation or housing everywhere they went. The vast majority of the time, their transportation or housing would go unused, and it would provide no value.
It is much more efficient for companies to own huge quantities of transportation or housing. That way, they can provide it to people only when those people need it. The same basic principle applies to computing power and storage space.
Sometimes you might need huge quantities of computing power or storage space, but most of the time, you do not. It would be extremely inefficient for you to have to own all of the servers necessary to manage your occasional increased need for computing power.
It is much more efficient to rent from an infrastructure as a service company so that you only have to pay for your computing or storage when you actually need it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s economical</strong>     <br>
Because IaaS resources are used on demand and enterprises only have to pay for the compute, storage, and networking resources that are actually used, IaaS costs are fairly predictable and can be easily contained and budgeted for.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s efficient</strong>            <br>
IaaS resources are regularly available to businesses when they need them. As a result, enterprises reduce delays when expanding infrastructure and, alternatively, don’t waste resources by overbuilding capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It boosts productivity</strong>             <br>
Because the cloud provider is responsible for setting up and maintaining the underlying physical infrastructure, enterprise IT departments save time and money and can redirect resources to more strategic activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s reliable</strong>          <br>
IaaS has no single point of failure. Even if any one component of the hardware resources fails, the service will usually still remain available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s scalable</strong>           <br>
One of the biggest advantages of IaaS in cloud computing is the capability to scale the resources up and down rapidly according to the needs of the enterprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It drives faster time to market</strong>            <br>
Because IaaS offers virtually infinite flexibility and scalability, enterprises can get their work done more efficiently, ensuring faster development life cycles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iaas-architecture">IaaS Architecture</h3>
<p>IaaS is broken into three main components: compute, network, and storage. With these offerings, users have the building blocks they need to create their customized systems, as complicated or powerful as they need, and the ability to scale up and down based on current needs.</p>
<h4 id="compute">Compute</h4>
<p>Foundational IaaS computing resources begin with servers. Servers are powerful computers that tend to have hundreds of Central Processing Units (CPUs), hundreds or thousands of gigabytes (GBs) of Random-access memory (RAM), and thousands of GBs of storage. Servers are expensive to buy and costly and difficult to maintain. IaaS providers maintain data centers that house the physical, bare-metal servers. These physical servers can be partitioned using a hypervisor into smaller “virtual machines”. These virtual machines can run their OS and applications independently while sourcing power from the bare-metal server. 
There are different ways to set up a virtual machine (VM), and the architecture you choose will depend on your needs and the level of abstraction you prefer.</p>
<p>Compute offerings often include optional add-ons like load balancing, which automatically distributes network traffic to prevent system overload. 
When users purchase a virtual machine through an IaaS provider, they choose the operating system, often referred to as an image, and applications run on that machine. Developers can easily scale vertically by adding more CPU if their VMs don’t have enough processing power or scaling horizontally to increase instances and handle more load. Virtual machines can often be quick and easy to set up.</p>
<h4 id="storage">Storage</h4>
<p>Storage options are threefold: file storage, object storage and block storage. 
File storage is similar to what we have on our computers at home and stores data as a single entity into a file. The files can exist within each other as other data, so it’s hierarchical. For example, a path for file storage could be “/home/photos/selfie.jpg”. Object storage instead takes saved data as a single entity and appends metadata and an identifier. Object storage deals with whole objects stored over the network. These objects could be things like an image file, logs, or HTML files. Object storage is the most popular option because of its simplicity and cost savings. Block storage is likely underneath the file or object storage. Block storage services are relatively familiar. They provide access to a traditional block storage device over the network and attach it to your virtual machine. It takes data and saves it as blocks of actual bytes or bits. It has advantages over the other two by being faster to transfer data but not user friendly unless abstracted by a file system like in your computer that uses it.</p>
<h4 id="network">Network</h4>
<p>The network function talks to the storage function, other VMs, containers, other servers, the internet, the intranet, and other components. It&rsquo;s how information is transferred through the architecture regardless of endpoints. Users will need different networking bandwidths depending on the amount of data transmitted between computing resources.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<p>IaaS has multiple applications that span industries, company sizes, and business needs. Startups and small companies may prefer IaaS to avoid the high costs of purchasing and maintaining hardware and software, and companies experiencing rapid growth like the scalability of IaaS. Larger companies may want the ability to buy only the space they will use. They also often use IaaS for redundancy in their setup and to take advantage of the high availability of public cloud providers. 
Some common use cases for IaaS are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website hosting:</strong> IaaS provides flexible hosting options for developers looking to get their websites up and running quickly and reliably. Using cloud services also allows builders to easily maintain and scale their sites as they grow.</li>
<li><strong>Startups:</strong> IaaS allows startups and other small businesses to avoid the high cost of purchasing and maintaining physical hardware to sustain a cool new idea. A startup in a rapid growth period can enjoy the scalability of IaaS.</li>
<li><strong>Testing and development:</strong> IaaS allows teams to quickly set up and tear down testing and development environments, allowing new applications to make it to market more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Storage and backup:</strong> Using IaaS for data storage and backup allows an organization to maintain resiliency without the significant overhead of additional on-site hardware. Using an IaaS provider can also help the team manage legal and compliance requirements that may otherwise be difficult to understand or implement.</li>
<li><strong>Building and maintaining web applications:</strong> IaaS provides the infrastructure needed to support web applications, such as storage, servers, and networking resources. Web applications can be quickly deployed on IaaS and then can continue to scale up and down with demand, providing reliability for the platform and cost savings for the team. </li>
<li><strong>High-performance computing needs:</strong> Organizations can solve complex problems and conduct detailed research and data analysis using supercomputers and computer grids or clusters. IaaS can provide the infrastructure to maintain those needs. Game developers and streaming services also utilize IaaS for flexibility, maintaining low latency, and saving bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iaas-pricing">IaaS Pricing</h3>
<p>Common IaaS pricing generally follows one of these models:</p>
<h4 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions:</h4>
<p>Some providers offer discounts for customers who commit to longer contract terms. Pricing for subscription-based services can be more favorable but also locks you into a vendor for a set amount of time, which can be a disadvantage if your needs change or your experience with that vendor is not up to your expectations.</p>
<h4 id="pay-as-you-go">Pay-as-you-go:</h4>
<p>The most common way for traditional IaaS providers to bill is by the hour/second, and users are only charged for what they use. This is beneficial in that generally, a pay-as-you-go model enables you to switch cloud providers easily if needed, and your bill may go up and down depending on usage. However, it can also lead to unexpected increases in cost if usage goes up and pricing models are not always clear.</p>

Compute Engine is a pay-per-usage service with a 10-minute minimum. There are no up-front fees or time-period commitments. GCE competes with Amazon&rsquo;s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>GCE&rsquo;s application program interface (API) provides administrators with virtual machine, DNS server and load balancing capabilities. VMs are available in a number of CPU and RAM configurations and Linux distributions, including Debian and CentOS. Customers may use their own system images for custom virtual machines. Data at rest is encrypted using the AEC-128-CBC algorithm.</p>
<p>GCE allows administrators to select the region and zone where certain data resources will be stored and used. Currently, GCE has three regions: United States, Europe and Asia. Each region has two availability zones and each zone supports either Ivy Bridge or Sandy Bridge processors. GCE also offers a suite of tools for administrators to create advanced networks on the regional level.

<h3 id="applications-of-compute-engine">Applications Of Compute Engine</h3>
<p>Below are some of the use-cases or applications of the Google compute engine:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Virtual Machine (VM) migration to Compute Engine:</strong> It provides tools to fast-track the migration process from on-premise or other clouds to GCP. If a user is starting with the public cloud, then they can leverage these tools to seamlessly transfer existing applications from their data center, AWS, or Azure to GCP. Users can have their applications running on Compute Engine within minutes while the data migrate transparently in the background.</li>
<li><strong>Genomics Data Processing:</strong> Processing genomic data is computationally-intensive because the information is enormous with vast sets of sequencing. With the Compute Engine’s potentials, users can process such large data sets. The platform is not only flexible but also scalable when it comes to processing genomic sequences.</li>
<li><strong>BYOL or Bring Your Own License images:</strong> A Compute Engine can help you run Windows apps in GCP by bringing their licenses to the platform as either license-included images or sole-tenant nodes. When users migrate to GCP, they can flexibly optimize their license and promote the bottom line.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="advantages-of-compute-engine">Advantages Of Compute Engine</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage Efficiency:</strong> The persistent disks support up to 257 TB of storage which is more than 10 times higher than what Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) can accommodate. The organizations that require more scalable storage options can go for Compute Engine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Within the GCP ecosystem, users pay only for the computing time that they have consumed. The per-second billing plan is used by the Google compute engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stability:</strong> It offers more stable services because of its ability to provide live migration of VMs between the hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backups:</strong> Google Cloud Platform has a robust, inbuilt, and redundant backup system. The Compute Engine uses this system for flagship products like Search Engine and Gmail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> It makes reservations to help ensure that applications have the capacity they need as they scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy Integration:</strong> It allows to easily integrate with other Google Cloud services like AI/ML and data analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Google Compute Engine is a more secure and safe place for cloud applications.</p>
</li>

	<p>We often have repetitive tasks to perform such as checking internet connection every few hours, maybe checking stock prices every few hours, or checking if that one product has gone on sale on an e-commerce site. Instead of having to do this manually, you can <em>schedule</em> these tasks to run at regular intervals.</p>
<p>For example, consider this <code>check_internet.sh</code> Bash script to check if you are connected to the internet or not by pinging Google&rsquo;s webpage:</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-cron-job">What is a cron job?</h3>
<p>Derived from the Greek God of Time, Chronos, a cron job is a task that is scheduled by a job scheduler such as <code>crontab</code> on Linux-based operating systems and by <code>cron</code> on a Unix-like operating system.</p>
<p>To learn more about the uncommon asterisk syntax, refer <a href="https://crontab.guru/">crontab.guru</a></p>
<p>Though checking the internet connection is a trivial example, we have seen in <a href="/a-z-cloud/docs/h/" title="Health Checks">health checks</a> how important it is to check if a server or an application is healthy (alive) or not.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-need-cloud-for-scheduling-cron-jobs">Why do you need cloud for scheduling cron jobs?</h3>
<p>From health checks to thousands of repetitive tasks such as fetching data from several APIs, to scheduling a job based on an event trigger, manually managing so many jobs becomes impossible. Hence, to manage jobs at scale, cloud is at our behest.</p>
<p>Job scheduling tools such as Google Cloud&rsquo;s Cloud Scheduler enable automation of execution of tasks based on date-time scheduling or other methods of execution such as event-based triggers. It eliminates the need for manual kick-offs, reducing delays and avoiding repetitive tasks.</p>

    <div class="lead"><h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>
</div>
	<p>Before starting with the technical jargon related to K8s, I would like to redirect y&rsquo;all to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stevenouri_mlops-devops-activity-6857456996527022080-TBeF">this post</a> which explains the usecase of kubernetes.</p>
<p>Hope y&rsquo;all now have a basic understanding of what it does. So, now let&rsquo;s move to some technical terminologies.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-kubernetesor-simply-k8s">What is Kubernetes(or simply K8s)?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.</p>
<p>There are two main words here: <em>container</em> and <em>orchestration</em>. We need to understand what each one is to understand Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-containers">What are Containers?</h3>
<p>Containers are a technology for packaging the (compiled) code for an application along with the dependencies it needs at run time. Each container that you run is repeatable; the standardisation from having dependencies included means that you get the same behaviour wherever you run it.</p>
<p>Pretty Complicated right? Let me explain it.</p>
<p>If we need to spin up a stack of applications in a server, such as a web application, database, messaging layer, etc., this will result in the following scenario.</p>
<p><img src="1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a hardware infrastructure on which an operating system (OS) runs, and libraries and application dependencies are installed over the OS. Different applications then share the same libraries and dependencies to run.</p>
<p>If you look into the design described, there are bound to be multiple problems. If you’ve rightly guessed, a web server might need a different version of a library as compared to the database server, for example, and one version of dependency can be compatible with one application but incompatible with another. If we need to upgrade one of the dependencies, we need to ensure that we do not impact another application that might not support it. This scenario is known as the Matrix of Hell and is a nightmare for developers and admins alike.</p>
<h4 id="solutions-1">Solutions 1:</h4>
<p><strong>Virtual Machines (VMs):</strong></p>
<p>A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer using software called a hypervisor. Some of the popular hypervisors in the market are VMWare and Oracle Virtual Box. A typical VM-based stack looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We have resolved the dependency problem, and now we are out of the Matrix of Hell. However, this introduces another issue. Instead of running a single OS within a machine, we now have multiple guest OSs running within a physical device.</p>
<h4 id="solutions-2">Solutions 2:</h4>
<p>Containers balance the problem out by treating servers as servers. We no longer have a separate VM for the webserver, database, and messaging. Instead, we have different containers for them.</p>
<p><img src="3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We have now got rid of the guest OS dependency, and containers now run as separate processes within the same OS. Containers make use of container runtimes. One of the famous container runtimes is Docker. I won&rsquo;t be talking about Docker here as it is a big concept in itself, however attaching a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stevenouri_buildwithai-programming-activity-6857289563795279872-ol7s?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">post</a> which gives a quick overview.</p>
<p>The idea of having multiple containers running within a server sounds tempting, but they come with their own set of problems. How you scale containers? How do you ensure that containers run and heal when they are unhealthy? What would happen if you suddenly see a spike and want to scale up your containers automatically? and many more&hellip;</p>
<p>Now this is where K8s comes to rescue.</p>
<h3 id="container-orchestration-using-kubernetes">Container Orchestration Using Kubernetes</h3>
<p>The idea of using Kubernetes is simple. You have a cluster of servers that are managed by Kubernetes, and Kubernetes is responsible for orchestrating your containers within the servers. You treat servers as servers, and you run applications within self-contained units called containers.</p>
<p>Since containers can run the same in any server, it does not matter on what server your container is running, as long as the client can reach it. If you need to scale your cluster, you can add or remove nodes to the cluster without worrying about the application architecture, zoning, roles, etc. You handle all of these at the Kubernetes level.</p>
<p>Kubernetes uses a simple concept to manage containers. There are master nodes (control plane) which control and orchestrate the container workloads, and the worker nodes where the containers run. Kubernetes run containers in pods, which form the basic building block in Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Following is a high-level architecture of a Kubernetes cluster:</p>

<p>Load Balancing</p>

<h3 id="what-is-load-balancing">What is Load Balancing?</h3>
<p>Imagine you’re in charge of a complex website, and it’s an online hit! It continues to face high amounts of traffic and you’re not sure your website backend can handle the amount of traffic from all over the world. You know you need to use load balancers, but the options are confusing. It can be hard to know exactly how to settle on a load balancing architecture that meets your needs, and figure out the prerequisites you need, for the best performance, without making too much of a dent in your wallet.
To start, you need to know what load balancing is and why it’s so important to the long-lasting success of your application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Load balancing is the process of distributing traffic across your network of servers to ensure that the system does not get overwhelmed and all requests are handled easily and efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern high‑traffic websites serve hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of concurrent requests from users or clients and return the correct text, images, video, or application data, all in a fast and reliable manner. You’ve probably all experienced visiting your favorite website, only to get long wait times, connection timeout errors, or images and videos buffering. And a lot of the times, this is because the website backend is unable to cost‑effectively scale to meet these high volumes.
The logical answer here is to add more backend servers to help serve traffic. But the next question becomes, how do you distribute traffic to those backend servers based on capacity and health?
This is where load balancing makes a splash.</p>
<p>In the seven-layer Open System Interconnection (OSI) model, network firewalls are at levels one to three (L1-Physical Wiring, L2-Data Link and L3-Network). Meanwhile, load balancing happens between layers four to seven (L4-Transport, L5-Session, L6-Presentation and L7-Application).</p>
<p><img src="1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="load-balancers">Load Balancers</h3>
<p>As an organization meets demand for its applications, the load balancer decides which servers can handle that traffic. This maintains a good user experience.
Load balancers manage the flow of information between the server and an endpoint device (PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone). The server could be on-premises, in a data center or the public cloud. The server can also be physical or virtualized. The load balancer helps servers move data efficiently, optimizes the use of application delivery resources and prevents server overloads. Load balancers conduct continuous health checks on servers to ensure they can handle requests. If necessary, the load balancer removes unhealthy servers from the pool until they are restored. Some load balancers even trigger the creation of new virtualized application servers to cope with increased demand.
Traditionally, load balancers consist of a hardware appliance. Yet they are increasingly becoming software-defined. This is why load balancers are an essential part of an organization’s digital strategy.</p>
<p>Load balancers have different capabilities, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>L4</strong> — directs traffic based on data from network and transport layer protocols, such as IP address and TCP port.</li>
<li><strong>L7</strong> — adds content switching to load balancing. This allows routing decisions based on attributes like HTTP header, uniform resource identifier, SSL session ID and HTML form data.</li>
<li><strong>GSLB</strong> — Global Server Load Balancing extends L4 and L7 capabilities to servers in different geographic locations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-load-balancing">Why Load Balancing?</h3>
<p>There is a limitation to the number of requests a single computer can handle at a given time. When faced with a sudden surge in requests, your application will load slowly, the network will time out, and your server will creak. You have two options: scale up or scale out.</p>
<p>When you scale up (vertical scale), you increase the capacity of a single machine by adding more storage (Disk) or processing power (RAM, CPU) to an existing single machine as needed on demand. But scaling up has a limit — you’ll get to a point where you cannot add more RAM or CPUs.</p>
<p>A better strategy is to scale out (horizontal scale), which involves the distribution of loads across as many servers as necessary to handle the workload. In this case, you can scale infinitely by adding more physical machines to an existing pool of resources.</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing-and-security">Load Balancing and Security</h3>
<p>Load Balancing plays an important security role as computing moves evermore to the cloud. The off-loading function of a load balancer defends an organization against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It does this by shifting attack traffic from the corporate server to a public cloud provider. DDoS attacks represent a large portion of cybercrime as their number and size continues to rise. Hardware defense, such as a perimeter firewall, can be costly and require significant maintenance. Software load balancers with cloud offload provide efficient and cost-effective protection.</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing-algorithms">Load Balancing Algorithms</h3>
<p>There are a variety of load balancing methods, which use different algorithms best suited for a particular situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Least Connection Method</strong> — directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections. Most useful when there are a large number of persistent connections in the traffic unevenly distributed between the servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Least Response Time Method</strong> — directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Round Robin Method</strong> — rotates servers by directing traffic to the first available server and then moves that server to the bottom of the queue. Most useful when servers are of equal specification and there are not many persistent connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Hash</strong> — the IP address of the client determines which server receives the request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-benefits">The Benefits</h3>
<p>Load balancing can do more than just act as a network traffic cop. Software load balancers provide benefits like predictive analytics that determine traffic bottlenecks before they happen. As a result, the software load balancer gives an organization actionable insights. These are key to automation and can help drive business decisions.
The benefits of load balancing include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Prevents Network Server Overload</strong>     <br>
When using load balancers in the cloud, you can distribute your workload among several servers, network units, data centers, and cloud providers. This lets you effectively prevent network server overload during traffic surges. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High Availability</strong>            <br>
The concept of high availability means that your entire system won’t be shut down whenever a system component goes down or fails. You can use load balancers to simply redirect requests to healthy nodes in the event that one fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better Resource Utilization</strong>             <br>
Load balancing is centered around the principle of efficiently distributing workloads across data centers and through multiple resources, such as disks, servers, clusters, or computers. It maximizes throughput, optimizes the use of available resources, avoids overload of any single resource, and minimizes response time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prevent a Single Source of Failure</strong>          <br>
Load balancers are able to detect unhealthy nodes in your cluster through various algorithmic and health-checking techniques. In the event of failure, loads can be transferred to a different node without affecting your users, affording you the time to address the problem rather than treating it as an emergency.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <div class="lead">High performance, scalable load balancing on Google Cloud Platform.</div>
	<p>Load balancers are managed services on GCP that distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application. GCP bears the burden of managing operational overhead and reduces the risk of having a non-functional, slow, or overburdened application.
With Google Cloud Load Balancing, you can serve content as close as possible to your users, on a system that can respond to over 1 million queries per second!</p>
<h3 id="different-load-balancing-options">Different load balancing options</h3>
<p>To decide which load balancer best suits your implementation, you need to think about whether you need</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Global</strong> or <strong>regional</strong> load balancing. Global load balancing means backend endpoints live in multiple regions. Regional load balancing means backend endpoints live in a single region.</li>
<li><strong>External</strong> or <strong>internal</strong> load balancing</li>
<li>What <strong>type of traffic</strong> you are serving? HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, TCP, UDP etc.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="external-load-balancer">External load balancer</h4>
<p>External load balancing includes four options:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP(S) Load Balancing for HTTP or HTTPS traffic,</li>
<li>TCP Proxy for TCP traffic for ports other than 80 and 8080, without SSL offload</li>
<li>SSL Proxy for SSL offload on ports other than 80 or 8080.</li>
<li>Network Load Balancing for TCP/UDP traffic.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<h5 id="https-load-balancers">HTTP(S) load balancers</h5>
<p>Global HTTP(S) load balancing if for layer-7 traffic
Google pushed load balancing out to the edge network on front-end servers, as opposed to using the traditional DNS-based approach. Thus, global load-balancing capacity can be behind a single Anycast virtual IPv4 or IPv6 address. This means you can deploy capacity in multiple regions without having to modify the DNS entries or add new load balancer IP address for new regions. So, it is clear that with global HTTP(S) load balancing, you get cross-region failover and overflow!</p>
<p>With global HTTP(S) load balancing, you get cross-region failover and overflow!
The distribution algorithm automatically directs traffic to the next closest instance with available capacity in the event of failure of or lack of capacity for instances in the region closest to end user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="proxy-based-load-balancers-tcp-and-ssl">Proxy based load balancers (TCP and SSL)</h5>
<p>Google Cloud also offers proxy-based load balancers for TCP and SSL traffic, and they use the same globally distributed infrastructure.
Use TCP proxy load balancer when you are dealing with TCP traffic and do not need SSL offload.
Generally speaking, your decision to use them would depend on whether you require SSL offload or not. You can find out more in the links below.
Use SSL proxy load balancer when you are dealing with TCP traffic and need SSL offload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="network-load-balancer">Network load balancer</h5>
<p>While the global HTTP(S) load balancer is for Layer-7 traffic and is built using the Google Front End Engines at the edge of Google’s network, the regional Network Load Balancer is for Layer-4 traffic and is built using Maglev.
Network load balancer is for the Layer-4 traffic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="internal-load-balancer">Internal Load Balancer</h4>
<p>With internal load balancing, you can run your applications behind an internal IP address and disperse HTTP/HTTPs traffic to your backend application hosted either on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Google Compute Engine (GCE).
The internal load balancer is a managed service that can only be accessed on an internal IP address and in the chosen region of your Virtual Private Cloud network. You can use it to route and balance load traffic to your virtual machines.</p>
<p>Similar to the HTTP(S) Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer, Internal L7 load balancer is neither a hardware appliance nor an instance-based solution, and can support as many connections per second as you need since there’s no load balancer in the path between your client and backend instances.
Internal layer 7 load balancer can support as many connections per second as your need!</p>

    <div class="lead"><h2 id="microservices">Microservices</h2>
</div>
	<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.</p>
<p>- Martin Fowler, Renowned author, Chief Scientist at ThoughtWorks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above quote on microservices architecture is often deemed to be the textbook definition. Before we dive into what is a microservice, let&rsquo;s look at the traditional practice of designing and developing software i.e., as a monolith.</p>
<h2 id="monolithic-architecture">Monolithic Architecture</h2>
<p>In a monolithic architecture, application tiers can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>part of the same unit</li>
<li>managed in a single repository</li>
<li>sharing existing resources (e.g. CPU and memory)</li>
<li>developed in one programming language</li>
<li>released using a single binary</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<img src="monolith-example.png" alt="Monolithic Architecture Example" height="30%" width="30%" />
</p>
<p>As student developers, we tend to follow this approach with a web framework such as Django or Spring where the UI and business logic are part of one repository. Thus, when we deploy such an application, we need to package the entire application as a single unit. Hence, if multiple people were to contribute on the application, their changes won&rsquo;t be reflected unless the entire application is deployed again.</p>
<h2 id="microservices-architecture">Microservices Architecture</h2>
<p>In a microservice architecture, application tiers are managed independently, as different units. Each unit has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>managed in a separate repository</li>
<li>own allocated resources (e.g. CPU and memory)</li>
<li>well-defined API for connection to other units</li>
<li>implemented using the programming language of choice</li>
<li>released using its own binary</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<img src="microservice-example.png" alt="Microservices Architecture Example" height="75%" width="75%" />
</p>
<p>To gain agility in the development cycle, several concerns (independent features) of a monolith can be split into microservices that can be developed and deployed individually. With such an architecture, the application becomes fault tolerant as there is no single point of failure - even if one microservice goes down or crashes, other microservices will still work at their concerns are independent.</p>
<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Development Complexity: represents the effort required to deploy and manage an application.</li>
<li>Scalability: captures how an application is able to scales up and down, based on the incoming traffic.</li>
<li>Time to Deploy: encapsulates the build of a delivery pipeline that is used to ship features.</li>
<li>Flexibility: implies the ability to adapt to new technologies and introduce new functionalities.</li>
<li>Operational Cost: represents the cost of necessary resources to release a product.</li>
<li>Reliability: captures practices for an application to recover from failure and tools to monitor an application.</li>

</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-cloud-run">Benefits of Cloud Run</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No vendor lock-in - Because Cloud Run takes standard OCI containers and implements the standard <a href="https://cloud.google.com/knative">Knative</a> Serving API, you can easily port over your applications to on-premises or any other cloud environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast autoscaling - Microservices deployed in Cloud Run scale automatically based on the number of incoming requests, without you having to configure or manage a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster. Cloud Run scales to zero— that is, uses no resources—if there are no requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split traffic - Cloud Run enables you to split traffic between multiple revisions, so you can perform gradual rollout such as canary deployments or blue/green deployments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom domains - You can set up custom domain mapping in Cloud Run and it will provision a TLS certificate for your domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic redundancy - Cloud Run offers automatic redundancy so you don’t have to worry about creating multiple instances for high availability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is an example of a microservices architecture using Cloud Run and several GCP services:</p>

	<blockquote>
<p>Note: Nginx is pronounced as &ldquo;engine-ex&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nginx is an open-source web server that, since its initial success as a web server, is now also used as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer.</p>
<p>Some high-profile companies using Nginx include Autodesk, Atlassian, Intuit, T-Mobile, GitLab, DuckDuckGo, Microsoft, IBM, Google, Adobe, Salesforce, VMWare, Xerox, LinkedIn, Cisco, Facebook, Target, Citrix Systems, Twitter, Apple, Intel, and many more.</p>
<p>Nginx was originally created by Igor Sysoev, with its first public release in October 2004. Igor initially conceived the software as an answer to the C10k problem, which is a problem regarding the performance issue of handling 10,000 concurrent connections.</p>
<p>Because its roots are in performance optimization under scale, Nginx often outperforms other popular web servers in benchmark tests, especially in situations with static content and/or high concurrent requests.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-nginx-work">How Does Nginx Work?</h3>
<p>Nginx is built to offer low memory usage and high concurrency. Rather than creating new processes for each web request, Nginx uses an asynchronous, event-driven approach where requests are handled in a single thread.</p>
<p>With Nginx, one master process can control multiple worker processes. The master maintains the worker processes, while the workers do the actual processing. Because Nginx is asynchronous, each request can be executed by the worker concurrently without blocking other requests.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-observability">What is Observability?</h3>
<p>In IT and cloud computing, observability is the ability to measure a system’s current state based on the data it generates, such as logs, metrics, and traces.</p>
<p>Observability relies on telemetry derived from instrumentation that comes from the endpoints and services in your multi-cloud computing environments. In these modern environments, every hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure component and every container, open-source tool, and microservice generates records of every activity. The goal of observability is to understand what’s happening across all these environments and among the technologies, so you can detect and resolve issues to keep your systems efficient and reliable and your customers happy.
Organizations usually implement observability using a combination of instrumentation methods including open-source instrumentation tools, such as OpenTelemetry.</p>
<p>Many organizations also adopt an observability solution to help them detect and analyze the significance of events to their operations, software development life cycles, application security, and end-user experiences.
Observability has become more critical in recent years, as cloud-native environments have gotten more complex and the potential root causes for a failure or anomaly have become more difficult to pinpoint. As teams begin collecting and working with observability data, they are also realizing its benefits to the business, not just IT.</p>
<p>Because cloud services rely on a uniquely distributed and dynamic architecture, observability may also sometimes refer to the specific software tools and practices businesses use to interpret cloud performance data. Although some people may think of observability as a buzzword for sophisticated application performance monitoring (APM), there are a few key distinctions to keep in mind when comparing observability and monitoring.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-monitoring-and-observability">What is the difference between monitoring and observability?</h3>
<p>Is observability really monitoring by another name? In short, no. While observability and monitoring are related — and can complement one another — they are actually different concepts.
In a monitoring scenario, you typically preconfigure dashboards that are meant to alert you to performance issues you expect to see later. However, these dashboards rely on the key assumption that you’re able to predict what kinds of problems you’ll encounter before they occur.
Cloud-native environments don’t lend themselves well to this type of monitoring because they are dynamic and complex, which means you have no way of knowing in advance what kinds of problems might arise.</p>
<p>In an observability scenario, where an environment has been fully instrumented to provide complete observability data, you can flexibly explore what’s going on and quickly figure out the root cause of issues you may not have been able to anticipate.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-observability">Benefits of observability</h3>
<p>Observability delivers powerful benefits to IT teams, organizations, and end-users alike. Here are some of the use cases observability facilitates:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Application performance monitoring:</strong> Full end-to-end observability enables organizations to get to the bottom of application performance issues much faster, including issues that arise from cloud-native and microservices environments. An advanced observability solution can also be used to automate more processes, increasing efficiency and innovation among Ops and Apps teams.</li>
<li><strong>DevSecOps and Site Reliability Engineering:</strong> Observability is not just the result of implementing advanced tools, but a foundational property of an application and its supporting infrastructure. The architects and developers who create the software must design it to be observed. Then DevSecOps and SRE teams can leverage and interpret the observable data during the software delivery life cycle to build better, more secure, more resilient applications. For the uninitiated, DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. It&rsquo;s an approach to culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle. Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a software engineering approach to IT operations.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure, cloud, and Kubernetes monitoring:</strong> Infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) teams can leverage the enhanced context an observability solution offers to improve application uptime and performance, cut down the time required to pinpoint and resolve issues, detect cloud latency issues and optimize cloud resource utilization, and improve administration of their Kubernetes environments and modern cloud architectures.</li>
<li><strong>End-user experience:</strong> A good user experience can enhance a company’s reputation and increase revenue, delivering an enviable edge over the competition. By spotting and resolving issues well before the end-user notices and making an improvement before it’s even requested, an organization can boost customer satisfaction and retention. It’s also possible to optimize the user experience through real-time playback, gaining a window directly into the end-user’s experience exactly as they see it, so everyone can quickly agree on where to make improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Business analytics:</strong> Organizations can combine business context with full stack application analytics and performance to understand real-time business impact, improve conversion optimization, ensure that software releases meet expected business goals, and confirm that the organization is adhering to internal and external SLAs.</li>
</ol>
<p>DevSecOps teams can tap observability to get more insights into the apps they develop, and automate testing and CI/CD processes so they can release better quality code faster. This means organizations waste less time on war rooms and finger-pointing. Not only is this a benefit from a productivity standpoint, but it also strengthens the positive working relationships that are essential for effective collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-challenges-of-observability">What are the challenges of observability?</h3>
<p>Observability has always been a challenge, but cloud complexity and the rapid pace of change has made it an urgent issue for organizations to address. Cloud environments generate a far greater volume of telemetry data, particularly when microservices and containerized applications are involved. They also create a far greater variety of telemetry data than teams have ever had to interpret in the past. Lastly, the velocity with which all this data arrives makes it that much harder to keep up with the flow of information, let alone accurately interpret it in time to troubleshoot a performance issue.</p>
<p>Organizations also frequently run into the following challenges with observability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data silos:</strong> — Multiple agents, disparate data sources, and siloed monitoring tools make it hard to understand interdependencies across applications, multiple clouds, and digital channels, such as web, mobile, and IoT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Volume, velocity, variety, and complexity:</strong> — It’s nearly impossible to get answers from the sheer amount of raw data collected from every component in ever-changing modern cloud environments, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This is also true for Kubernetes and containers that can spin up and down in seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual instrumentation and configuration:</strong> — When IT resources are forced to manually instrument and change code for every new type of component or agent, they spend most of their time trying to set up observability rather than innovating based on insights from observability data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of pre-production:</strong> — Even with load testing in pre-production, developers still don’t have a way to observe or understand how real users will impact applications and infrastructure before they push code into production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wasting time troubleshooting:</strong> — Application, operations, infrastructure, development, and digital experience teams are pulled in to troubleshoot and try to identify the root cause of problems, wasting valuable time guessing and trying to make sense of telemetry and come up with answers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, not all types of telemetry data are equally useful for determining the root cause of a problem or understanding its impact on the user experience. As a result, teams are still left with the time-consuming task of digging for answers across multiple solutions and painstakingly interpreting the telemetry data, when they could be applying their expertise toward fixing the problem right away. However, with a single source of truth, teams can get answers and troubleshoot issues much faster.</p>

	<h3 id="what-is-opentelemetry">What is OpenTelemetry?</h3>
<p>OpenTelemetry (also referred to as OTel) is an open-source observability framework made up of a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Otel enables IT teams to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data for analysis and to understand software performance and behavior.</p>
<p>Having a common format for how observability data is collected and sent is where OpenTelemetry comes into play. As a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) incubating project, OTel aims to provide unified sets of vendor-agnostic libraries and APIs — mainly for collecting data and transferring it somewhere. Since the project’s start, many vendors have come on board to help make rich data collection easier and more consumable.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-telemetry-data">What is telemetry data?</h3>
<p>Capturing data is critical to understanding how your applications and infrastructure are performing at any given time. This information is gathered from remote, often inaccessible points within your ecosystem and processed by some sort of tool or equipment. Monitoring begins here. The data is incredibly plentiful and difficult to store over long periods due to capacity limitations — a reason why private and public cloud storage services have been a boon to DevOps teams.</p>
<p>Logs, metrics, and traces make up the bulk of all telemetry data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Logs</strong> are important because you’ll naturally want an event-based record of any notable anomalies across the system. Structured, unstructured, or in plain text, these readable files can tell you the results of any transaction involving an endpoint within your multicloud environment. However, not all logs are inherently reviewable — a problem that’s given rise to external log analysis tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong> are numerical data points represented as counts or measures that are often calculated or aggregated over a period of time. Metrics originate from several sources including infrastructure, hosts, and third-party sources. While logs aren’t always accessible, most metrics tend to be reachable via query. Timestamps, values, and even event names can preemptively uncover a growing problem that needs remediation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traces</strong> are the act of following a process (for example, an API request or other system activity) from start to finish, showing how services connect. Keeping a watch over this pathway is critical to understanding how your ecosystem works, if it’s working effectively, and if any troubleshooting is necessary. Span data is a hallmark of tracing — which includes information such as unique identifiers, operation names, timestamps, logs, events, and indexes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-opentelemetry-work">How does OpenTelemetry work?</h3>
<p>OTel is a specialized protocol for collecting telemetry data and exporting it to a target system. Since the CNCF project itself is open source, the end goal is making data collection more system-agnostic than it currently is. But how is that data generated?</p>
<p>The data life cycle has multiple steps from start to finish. Here are the steps the solution takes, and the data it generates along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instruments your code with APIs, telling system components what metrics to gather and how to gather them</li>
<li>Pools the data using SDKs, and transports it for processing and exporting</li>
<li>Breaks down the data, samples it, filters it to reduce noise or errors, and enriches it using multi-source contextualization</li>
<li>Converts and exports the data</li>
<li>Conducts more filtering in time-based batches, then moves the data onward to a predetermined backend.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opentelemetry-components">OpenTelemetry components</h3>
<p>OTel consists of a few different components as depicted in the following figure. Let’s take a high-level look at each one from left to right:</p>
<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000236551/dt-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OT.png" alt="OpenTelemetry Components" >
</p>
<p align = "center">
OpenTelemetry Components
</p>   
<br/>
<h5 id="apis">APIs</h5>
<p>These are core components and language-specific (such as Java, Python, .Net, and so on). APIs provide the basic “plumbing” for your application.</p>
<h5 id="sdk">SDK</h5>
<p>This is also a language-specific component and is the middleman that provides the bridge between the APIs and the exporter. The SDK allows for additional configuration, such as request filtering and transaction sampling.</p>
<h5 id="in-process-exporter">In-process exporter</h5>
<p>This allows you to configure which backend(s) you want it sent to. The exporter decouples the instrumentation from the backend configuration. This makes it easy to switch backends without the pain of re-instrumenting your code.</p>
<h5 id="collector">Collector</h5>
<p>The collector receives, processes, and exports telemetry data. While not technically required, it is an extremely useful component to the OpenTelemetry architecture because it allows greater flexibility for receiving and sending the application telemetry to the backend(s).
The collector has two deployment models:</p>
<ol>
<li>An agent that resides on the same host as the application (for example, binary, DaemonSet, sidecar, and so on)</li>
<li>A standalone process completely separate from the application
Since the collector is just a specification for collecting and sending telemetry, it still requires a backend to receive and store the data.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits-of-opentelemetry">Benefits of OpenTelemetry</h3>
<p>OTel provides a de facto standard for adding observable instrumentation to cloud-native applications. This means companies don’t need to spend valuable time developing a mechanism for collecting critical application data and can spend more time delivering new features instead.
It’s akin to how Kubernetes became the standard for container orchestration. This broad adoption has made it easier for organizations to implement container deployments since they don’t need to build their own enterprise-grade orchestration platform. Using Kubernetes as the analog for what it can become, it’s easy to see the benefits it can provide to the entire industry.</p>

    <div class="lead">An initiative to enable reusable, open source, vendor neutral instrumentation for distributed tracing.</div>
	<blockquote>
<p>Ideas about distributed tracing and monitoring across multiple systems have certainly generated quite a buzz. It’s becoming more important than ever before to be able to see what’s going on inside our requests as they span across multiple software services. Aiming to harness this importance, the OpenTracing initiative has sprung up to help developers avoid vendor lock-in.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-is-distributed-tracing">What Is Distributed Tracing?</h3>
<p>Distributed tracing is a mechanism you can use to profile and monitor applications. Unlike regular tracing, distributed tracing is more suited to applications built using a microservice architecture, hence the name.</p>
<p>Distributed tracing tracks a single request through all of its journey, from its source to its destination, unlike traditional forms of tracing which just follow a request through a single application domain.
In other words, we can say that distributed tracing is the stitching of multiple requests across multiple systems. The stitching is often done by one or more correlation IDs, and the tracing is often a set of recorded, structured log events across all the systems, stored in a central place.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-opentracing">What is OpenTracing?</h3>
<p>It’s a vendor-agnostic API to help developers easily instrument tracing into their code base. It’s open because no one company owns it. </p>
<p>OpenTracing wants to form a common language around what a trace is and how to instrument them in our applications. In OpenTracing, a trace is a directed acyclic graph of Spans with References that may look like this</p>
<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DSC-VJTI/a-z-cloud/main/content/docs/O/1.png">
</p>
<br/>
<p>This allows us to model how our application calls out to other applications, internal functions, asynchronous jobs, etc. All of these can be modeled as Spans, as we’ll see below.</p>
<p>For example, if I have a consumer website where a customer places orders, I make a call to my payment system and my inventory system before asynchronously acknowledging the order. I can trace the entire order process through every system with an OpenTracing library and can render it like this:</p>
<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DSC-VJTI/a-z-cloud/main/content/docs/O/2.png">
</p>
<br/>
<p>Each one of these bracketed blocks is a Span representing a separate software system communicating over messaging or HTTP.</p>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>Let’s talk a bit about the components of the OpenTracing API.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracer</strong>    <br>
This tracer is the entry point into the tracing API. It gives us the ability to create Spans. It also lets us extract tracing information from external sources and inject information to external destinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Span</strong>    <br>
This represents a unit of work in the Trace. For example, a web request that initiates a new Trace is called the root Span. If it calls out to another web service, that HTTP request would be wrapped within a new child Span. Spans carry around a set of tags of information pertinent to the request being carried out. You can also log events within the context of a Span. They can support more complex workflows than web requests, such as asynchronous messaging. They have timestamps attached to them so we can easily construct a timeline of events for the Trace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SpanContext</strong>   <br>
The SpanContext is the serializable form of a Span. It lets Span information transfer easily across the wire to other systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>References</strong>      <br>
So far, Spans can connect to each other via two types of relationship: ChildOf and FollowsFrom. ChildOf Spans are spans like in our previous example, where our ordering website sent child requests to both our payment system and inventory system. FollowsFrom Spans are just a chain of sequential Spans. So, a FollowsFrom Span is just saying, “I started after this other Span.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="is-opentracing-still-in-use">Is OpenTracing still in Use?</h3>
<p>OpenTracing is an open-source CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) project which provides vendor-neutral APIs and instrumentation for distributed tracing. Although OpenTracing and OpenCensus have merged to form OpenTelemetry in early 2019, third-party libraries and frameworks like Hazelcast IMDG still come equipped with OpenTracing pre-instrumentation.</p>
<p>OpenTracing became a CNCF project back in 2016, with the goal of providing a vendor-agnostic specification for distributed tracing, offering developers the ability to trace a request from start to finish by instrumenting their code. Then, Google made the OpenCensus project open source in 2018. This was based on Google’s Census library that was used internally for gathering traces and metrics from their distributed systems. Like the OpenTracing project, the goal of OpenCensus was to give developers a vendor-agnostic library for collecting traces and metrics.
This led to two competing tracing frameworks, which led to the informal reference “the Tracing Wars.” Usually, competition is a good thing for end-users since it breeds innovation. However, in the open-source specification world, competition can lead to poor adoption, contribution, and support.
Going back to the Kubernetes example, imagine how much more disjointed and slow-moving container adoption would be if everybody was using a different orchestration solution. To avoid this, it was announced at KubeCon 2019 in Barcelona that the OpenTracing and OpenCensus projects would converge into one project called OpenTelemetry and join the CNCF.</p>
