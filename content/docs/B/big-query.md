BigQuery's serverless infrastructure lets you focus on your data instead of resource management. BigQuery combines a cloud-based data warehouse and powerful analytic tools.

### BigQuery storage

- BigQuery stores data using a columnar storage format that is optimized for analytical queries.

- BigQuery presents data in tables, rows, and columns and provides full support for database transaction semantics (ACID).

- BigQuery storage is automatically replicated across multiple locations to provide high availability.

### BigQuery analytics

- Descriptive and prescriptive analysis uses include business intelligence, ad hoc analysis, geospatial analytics, and machine learning.

- You can query data stored in BigQuery or run queries on data where it lives using external tables or federated queries including Cloud Storage, Bigtable, Spanner, or Google Sheets stored in Google Drive.
