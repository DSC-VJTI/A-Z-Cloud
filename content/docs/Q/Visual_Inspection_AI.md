### Other Use-cases

**Automotive manufacturing**: Paint shop surface inspection, body shop welding seam inspection, press shop inspection (scratch, dents, cracks, staining), foundry engine block inspection (cracks, deformation, anomaly)

**Semiconductor manufacturing**: Wafer level anomaly and defect localization, die crack inspection, pre-place inspection, SoC packaging inspection, board assembly inspection

**Electronics manufacturing**: Defective or missing printed circuit board (PCB) components (screw, spring, foam, connector, shield, etc.), PCB soldering and gluing (insufficient solder, Icicle, shift, exceeding tin, etc.), product surface check (glue spill, mesh deformation, scratches, bubbles, etc.)

**General-purpose manufacturing**: Packaging and label inspection, fabric inspection (mesh, tear, yarn), metal and plastic welding seam inspection, surface inspection
