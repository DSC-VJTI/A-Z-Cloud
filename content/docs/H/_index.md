  ## Health Checks
---

> Disclaimer: This is going to be a comparatively simple concept, but a highly important concept, so important that from the smallest of all application servers of small scale companies to the application servers of large MNCs, they all use this concept.

What does buying a car and managing a cloud environment have in common? If you don't pay attention they both can end up costing you much more than expected. That’s why keeping a close eye on your cloud environment is very important, **and this is what health checks do**.

Health Checks check the working status of your servers by sending them periodic messages, the servers in turn reply to these messages. If the server fails to respond to these messages, it would be considered that the server isn't functioning properly and appropriate actions would be taken.

The actions include:

- Sending Emails to the administrator
- Sending SMS to the administrator
- Running some scripts
- And many others.

### Benefits of Health Checks

- Increased cloud efficiency

  In a fast-paced environment, it’s expected that operational decisions be made quickly. The Health Check provides a high-level summary of your cloud environment to help you make more informed decisions, faster.

- Improved cloud governance 

  Your cloud environment is only as good as the hygiene that you establish for it— and your organization’s diligence to keep those practices in place long term. Especially if you are just starting in your cloud environment, you might not be aware of common pitfalls. For example, assets that are unallocated or untagged, such as untagged instances, are very common. If not addressed quickly, they can lead to a lot of cloud resource waste. The Health Check gives you a quick snapshot to help identify these assets and allow you to build and customize reports to focus on a particular business unit, owner, environment or function.

- De-risk your cloud with confidence

  Security is a critical component for any cloud environment. In this day and age, keeping data safe and secure is equally, if not more important, than reducing cost increasing agility. Health Checks highlights any potential security vulnerabilities. This alerts your team to take any necessary actions needed before something can potentially go wrong. As they say, prevention is better than cure. This report gives you recommendations about security related events in your cloud environment.
